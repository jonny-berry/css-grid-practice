# CSS Grid Dashboard
### Built with 
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox)

This is a dashboard project I built while learning CSS grid through The Odin Project.

The entire layout is made with grids... I'm talking ***grids on grids on grids***.

It features a responsive design for desktop and tablet screens.
